## Finite Element Libraries:
* [deal.II](https://www.dealii.org): C++ based finite element simulation package
* [deal2lkit](https://github.com/mathLab/deal2lkit): A ToolKit library for deal.II
* [PRISMS-PF](http://prisms-center.github.io/phaseField/): An open-source, general purpose framework for high-performance phase field modeling(using deal.II by UMich)
  This will give a good example on how to build your own applications on top of deal.II using CMake:

* [libMesh](https://libmesh.github.io/): adaptive finite element library
* [MOOSE](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/): Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment finite element framework, built on top of libMesh and PETSc
* [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/) Python based finite element simulation package

## IGA
* [IGA-dealii](https://github.com/mathLab/IGA-dealii): Isogeometric Analysis classes for the deal.II library
* [G+Smo](https://gismo.github.io/):
G+Smo (Geometry + Simulation Modules, pronounced "gismo") is an open-source C++ library that brings together mathematical tools for geometric design and numerical simulation. It implements the relatively new paradigm of isogeometric analysis, which suggests the use of a unified framework in the design and analysis pipeline. G+Smo is an object-oriented, cross-platform, template C++ library and follows the generic programming principle, with a focus on both efficiency and ease of use. The library aims at providing access to high quality, open-source software to the forming isogeometric numerical simulation community and beyond.
